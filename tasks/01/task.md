# FLAG 1

IFNGR2 encodes the non-ligand-binding beta chain of the gamma interferon receptor. Using the provided annotations, contained in the folder `data`, find how many transcripts this gene has. Submit the used script, together with the results.

The script should receive the file in input as argument, to be used as 

```
./script1.sh annotation.gtf
```

And should produce the submitted output.

**HINTS**:
- .gff files are tab-delimited. Gene annotations are typically in the 9th field and entry type is in the 3rd.
 - You can use `grep`, `cut`, `awk`, `find`, etc.
